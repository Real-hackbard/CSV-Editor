CSV editor is a tool for viewing and modifying CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, which store data in a plain text, tabular format. While simple text editors can be used, dedicated CSV editors often provide a spreadsheet-like interface, offering features like automated delimiter detection, custom shortcuts, and the ability to handle large files, making data manipulation easier and preventing data corruption. Options range from simple, privacy-focused online tools to robust desktop applications, with some offering advanced features like data analysis, scripting with JavaScript, and even support for massive datasets beyond what traditional spreadsheets can handle.

### How CSV Editors Work:
* Tabular View: They display CSV data in a visual grid, allowing you to see rows and columns as you would in a spreadsheet. 
* File Upload/Selection: You select or upload a CSV file directly into the editor. 
* In-Browser Editing: Many online editors allow you to make changes directly within the web browser without needing to download and re-upload the file. 
* Delimiter Detection: Editors can automatically identify the separator (e.g., comma, semicolon) used in your file, ensuring the data is displayed and saved correctly. 
* Data Export: After editing, you can download the modified data back as a CSV file.

### User-Friendly Interface:
Provides a familiar spreadsheet-like experience for easy data viewing and editing. 

### Data Integrity:
Prevents common issues like numerical truncation or unwanted type conversions that can occur in general-purpose applications like Excel. 

### Efficiency:
Designed for speed, enabling quick loading and editing of both small and large CSV files. 
### Customization:
Some editors allow for custom keyboard shortcuts, UI themes, and cell formatting.
